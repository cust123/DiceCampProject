# üöÄ DevOps Capstone Project: Enhanced Implementation Plan & System Design

## üìò Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world production-grade DevOps workflow and will provide hands-on experience with containerization, infrastructure automation, monitoring, CI/CD pipelines, REST APIs, database logging, and web-based user interfaces.

### üéØ Objective:

Build, deploy, monitor, and manage a containerized microservice architecture with the following components:

- REST-based file exchange between server and client
- Web UI for interaction
- Database integration (MongoDB)
- Logging and monitoring via Grafana
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Full AWS deployment via Terraform

---

## üß± System Design & Architecture

### üóÇÔ∏è Repositories

- `server-app` GitHub repository
- `client-app` GitHub repository
  Each repository will contain:
- Dockerfile
- Application code
- Terraform scripts (in `/terraform` directory)
- CI/CD GitHub Actions workflows
- README.md with detailed instructions

## üìã Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Application Development & Local Docker Deployment (Completed)

### üéØ Objectives:

- Develop a RESTful server that generates a file and returns its checksum
- Create a web-based client to trigger the fetch, receive the file, verify checksum, and log results in MongoDB
- Set up local MongoDB using Docker
- Integrate all services using a **single unified `docker-compose.yml`** for seamless orchestration

---

### üß± What We Implemented

#### üîπ Server (Flask App)

- Endpoint `/generate` creates a 1KB file with random text in `/serverdata`
- Calculates SHA256 checksum
- `/file` endpoint sends the generated file to the client
- Uses environment variables from `.env`
- Built with `python:3.10-slim`

#### üîπ Client (Flask Web UI)

- Homepage (`/`) contains a button to fetch file from server
- `/fetch` endpoint:

  - Calls server's `/generate` and `/file`
  - Saves file to `/clientdata`
  - Computes checksum
  - Logs metadata into MongoDB: `timestamp`, `filename`, `checksum`, `verified`, `status`, `client_ip`

- Uses environment variables from `.env`
- MongoDB is connected via `pymongo`

#### üîπ MongoDB

- Runs locally as a container with persistent named volume
- No schema creation needed (auto-created via insert)
- DB name: `filelogs`
- Collection: `logs`

#### üîπ Unified `docker-compose.yml`

- Placed in root directory
- Builds all services (`client`, `server`, `mongo`)
- Shares network, volumes, and env files

### üêû Problems Faced & Resolutions

| Problem                                                   | Root Cause                                    | Fix                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pull access denied for server-app`                       | Docker tried to pull instead of build locally | Used `build:` with `context: ./serverSideApp` instead of `image:`          |
| `Bind for 0.0.0.0:5001 failed: port is already allocated` | Port conflict from already running container  | Stopped old container and used `docker-compose down` before restarting     |
| MongoDB not logging correctly                             | Missing `client_ip` and `filename` fields     | Updated `client.py` to include `flask_request.remote_addr` and `filename`  |
| Confusion between multiple `docker-compose.yml` files     | Split Compose definitions in two directories  | Consolidated into **one root-level unified Compose file** for all services |

### üîÅ Reproducible Steps for Local Deployment

You can reproduce this working setup by following these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/devops-capstone
   cd devops-capstone
   ```

2. **Ensure Folder Structure Looks Like:**

   ```
   devops-capstone/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ clientSideApp/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ serverSideApp/
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
   ```

3. **Review Environment Variables**

   `clientSideApp/.env`:

   ```env
   FLASK_ENV=production
   PORT=5000
   DATA_DIR=/clientdata
   SERVER_HOST=http://server:5001
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/
   ```

   `serverSideApp/.env`:

   ```env
   FLASK_ENV=production
   PORT=5001
   DATA_DIR=/serverdata
   ```

4. **Build & Run All Services**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

5. **Access the App**

   | Service    | URL                                                              |
   | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Client UI  | [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)                   |
   | Server API | [http://localhost:5001/generate](http://localhost:5001/generate) |
   | MongoDB    | mongodb://localhost:27017                                        |

6. **Verify MongoDB Logs**

   ```bash
   docker exec -it <mongo-container-id> mongosh
   > use filelogs
   > db.logs.find().pretty()
   ```

7. **Stop Services**

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```
