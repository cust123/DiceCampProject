# üöÄ DevOps Capstone Project: Enhanced Implementation Plan & System Design

## üìò Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world production-grade DevOps workflow and will provide hands-on experience with containerization, infrastructure automation, monitoring, CI/CD pipelines, REST APIs, database logging, and web-based user interfaces.

### üéØ Objective:

Build, deploy, monitor, and manage a containerized microservice architecture with the following components:

- REST-based file exchange between server and client
- Web UI for interaction
- Database integration (MongoDB)
- Logging and monitoring via Grafana
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Full AWS deployment via Terraform

## üìã Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Application Development & Local Docker Deployment (Completed)

### üéØ Objectives:

- Develop a RESTful server that generates a file and returns its checksum
- Create a web-based client to trigger the fetch, receive the file, verify checksum, and log results in MongoDB
- Set up local MongoDB using Docker
- Integrate all services using a **single unified `docker-compose.yml`** for seamless orchestration

---

### üß± What We Implemented

#### üîπ Server (Flask App)

- Endpoint `/generate` creates a 1KB file with random text in `/serverdata`
- Calculates SHA256 checksum
- `/file` endpoint sends the generated file to the client
- Uses environment variables from `.env`
- Built with `python:3.10-slim`

#### üîπ Client (Flask Web UI)

- Homepage (`/`) contains a button to fetch file from server
- `/fetch` endpoint:

  - Calls server's `/generate` and `/file`
  - Saves file to `/clientdata`
  - Computes checksum
  - Logs metadata into MongoDB: `timestamp`, `filename`, `checksum`, `verified`, `status`, `client_ip`

- Uses environment variables from `.env`
- MongoDB is connected via `pymongo`

#### üîπ MongoDB

- Runs locally as a container with persistent named volume
- No schema creation needed (auto-created via insert)
- DB name: `filelogs`
- Collection: `logs`

#### üîπ Unified `docker-compose.yml`

- Placed in root directory
- Builds all services (`client`, `server`, `mongo`)
- Shares network, volumes, and env files

---

### üêû Problems Faced & Resolutions

| Problem                                                   | Root Cause                                    | Fix                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pull access denied for server-app`                       | Docker tried to pull instead of build locally | Used `build:` with `context: ./serverSideApp` instead of `image:`          |
| `Bind for 0.0.0.0:5001 failed: port is already allocated` | Port conflict from already running container  | Stopped old container and used `docker-compose down` before restarting     |
| MongoDB not logging correctly                             | Missing `client_ip` and `filename` fields     | Updated `client.py` to include `flask_request.remote_addr` and `filename`  |
| Confusion between multiple `docker-compose.yml` files     | Split Compose definitions in two directories  | Consolidated into **one root-level unified Compose file** for all services |

---

### üîÅ Reproducible Steps for Local Deployment

You can reproduce this working setup by following these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/devops-capstone
   cd devops-capstone
   ```

2. **Ensure Folder Structure Looks Like:**

   ```
   devops-capstone/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ clientSideApp/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ serverSideApp/
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
   ```

3. **Review Environment Variables**

   `clientSideApp/.env`:

   ```env
   FLASK_ENV=production
   PORT=5000
   DATA_DIR=/clientdata
   SERVER_HOST=http://server:5001
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/
   ```

   `serverSideApp/.env`:

   ```env
   FLASK_ENV=production
   PORT=5001
   DATA_DIR=/serverdata
   ```

4. **Build & Run All Services**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

5. **Access the App**

   | Service    | URL                                                              |
   | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Client UI  | [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)                   |
   | Server API | [http://localhost:5001/generate](http://localhost:5001/generate) |
   | MongoDB    | mongodb://localhost:27017                                        |

6. **Verify MongoDB Logs**

   ```bash
   docker exec -it <mongo-container-id> mongosh
   > use filelogs
   > db.logs.find().pretty()
   ```

7. **Stop Services**

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

üß† Lessons Learned

Topic

Insight Gained

Docker Networking

Services communicate using container names over default bridge network

SSL with Nginx

Certbot simplifies free HTTPS but must handle renewal and firewall rules

GitHub Actions SSH

Deployment requires key-based auth, secrets management, and idempotency

MongoDB Atlas

Quick cloud DB setup; schema-less but needs careful validation

EC2 Access

Initial SSH and firewall setup is crucial to avoid lockouts

DNS Propagation

DNS changes may take minutes to reflect globally

Flask + UI
